# BE-Project
This project is a Virtual Lab Simulation that visually explains how Condenser and Chilled Water Systems work along with their electrical distribution. It helps users understand the connection between mechanical and electrical parts used in HVAC systems.  Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG, the project includes an interactive schematic.
